# Course Offering Website Opener (A very simple Selenium Project)
This is a very simple script designed to make things a little bit easier. 
In my university, we have a course offerings page that shows whether a course is being offered this term and if it is in fact offered who is the instructor, the syllabus etc.
I realized that by slightly tweaking the url, I can access information about all courses. Also, it is possible to change the term part in the url to see if a course is going to be offered in upcoming terms.
I had added a dummy course to my reading list and I had been modifying the url to access future / past course pages.
Then I realized I can actually create a code to automatically create the url for me and then use Selenium webdriver to open that webpage for me.

When you run this code, it will ask you the term, year, subject, course code and open a page for you.
At least for Mac, I recommend adding this code to your user library since the terminal opens on user library by default.
